# This is a project like GiaoHangTietKiem, for users to make a shipment 
- This project use PHP and Block engine to use util tool like Blade of Laravel

- For styling, use Bootstrap V5 and Alpine to create UI

This is project structure:
```
<directory_structure>
assets/ # all assets
  css/
    reset.css
    style.css
common/ # common php function
  utils/
    function.php
  views/
    block.php
pages/ # main routing 
  index.php
views/ #view directory
  components/ #component view
    about-us.view.php
    banner.view.php
    nations.view.php
    topbar.view.php
  layouts/ #app layout
    master.view.php
  pages/
    landing.view.php
.htaccess
composer.json
</directory_structure>
```

Rules:
- Never write comment to code
- Priority to split UI code to component
- Prefer using Bootstrap class, instead of make class yourself
